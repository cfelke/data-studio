#1 problem: 
I want to map the rate of homelessness over the last 50 years. HUB only allows you to go back to 2007, they started the PIT count in 2005.
And it's never per county, only states or CoC (CoC = regional or local body that coordinates housing & services funding for homeless people.
A CoC can literally be anything: cities, suburbs, rural areas..)

#2 problem:
After looking for more than an hour for any data about homelessness/counties it seems that there is none!
Sad. So I can either focus on one or two specific cities like L.A. and NYC (looked into their datasets, didn't see any going back more than 
3 yrs) or do a choropleth showing homelessness per state over the course of 10 years.
