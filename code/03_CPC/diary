The report Guttmacher 2014 states: 
'Of the 2,313 facilities in the universe of potential­abortion-providing facilities...' and further: 
'Undoubtedly, some facilities that provide abortion care, especially those with small caseloads, are not known to us and are 
excluded from our census. To address this issue, we used the American Medical Association's master list to obtain a random sample of 
2,000 physicians who identified their specialty as obstetrics and gynecology,‡ and who provided a phone number(...)'

**regarding types of abortion-providing facilities**
'We distinguished among four types of abortion-­providing facilities: abortion clinics, nonspecialized clinics, hospitals and physicians’ 
offices. Abortion clinics are defined as nonhospital facilities in which half or more of patient visits are for abortion services, 
regardless of annual abortion case­load. Nonspecialized clinics are nonhospital sites in which fewer than half of patient visits are for 
abortion services. Physicians’ offices are defined as facilities that provide fewer than 400 abortions per year and have names suggesting 
that they are private practices. Physicians’ offices that provide 400 or more abortions per year were categorized as nonspecialized clinics; 
because of their relatively large caseload, we assume that their service provision more closely mirrors that of a nonspecialized clinic.

Eighty percent of nonhospital facilities provided information on early medication abortion, 60% provided information on self-induced 
abortion and 63% answered items about lost service days. Response rates to these measures varied by facility type and caseload, and we 
constructed weights to account for these differences.'

**conclusion**
'In 2014, a total of 1,671 facilities provided at least one abortion'
