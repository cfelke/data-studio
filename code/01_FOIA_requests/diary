Extracting so many tables with tabula takes a lot of time, wow.
And thanks FOIA gov for only publishing a fraction of the EPA's annual FOIA reports, I should have looked in the agency's report at the first place.

_problems
I worked on a dataframe literally consisting of one line for hours (yup, horrible). I'll never do this again. 
Just type the df by hand, it saves you from so much trouble. 

I don't know how to sort_values a waffle graph, do I really need to type the values in descending order, like manually?
This can't be true.
